# Peer contract

Every implementation ships a peer program. The cross-language suite in go-ipc's `interop/` runs peers in different languages against each other. A peer takes a role and its arguments:

```
peer <role> <args...>
```

A peer exits 0 on success. On any failure it prints the reason to stderr and exits 1. Each role gives up after seconds and fails. A role that creates an endpoint prints `ready` and a newline to stdout, and flushes, once the endpoint exists. The suite waits for that line before it starts the other side.

| role | arguments | behavior |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `recv` | `<name> <total> <capacity>` | Create queue `name` with `capacity`. Print `ready`. Receive `total` messages. Each payload is `<sender>:<seq>` in ASCII decimal, and the type equals `seq`. For each sender, `seq` must run 0, 1, 2 and so on with no gap. Print `ok <total>`. Close and unlink. |
| `send` | `<name> <sender> <count>` | Open queue `name`. Send `count` messages with type `i` and payload `<sender>:<i>`, for `i` from 0. Close. |
| `listen-echo` | `<name> <capacity>` | Listen on `name` with `capacity`. Print `ready`. Copy every byte read back to the writer until end-of-stream. Close and unlink. |
| `dial-check` | `<name> <bytes>` | Dial `name`. Write `bytes` bytes, where byte `i` is `(i * 31 + 7) mod 256`. Read the same count back and compare. Close. Then read once more and require end-of-stream. |
| `typed-send` | `<name>` | Open queue `name`. Send each value of `spec/vectors/schema/values.json` in order, encoded with the `ipcgen` code for this language, with the message type ID as the queue type. Close. |
| `typed-recv` | `<name> <capacity>` | Create queue `name`. Print `ready`. Receive one message per value in `values.json`, decode it by its type ID, and require it to equal the value. Print `ok`. Close and unlink. |

`dial-check` writes and reads at the same time. The ring holds less than the stream, so a peer that writes everything before it reads deadlocks.

The `typed-*` roles find `values.json` through the `GOIPC_SPEC_DIR` environment variable, which names the root of this repository.
